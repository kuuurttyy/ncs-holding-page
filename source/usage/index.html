                NCS tracks used in commercial content (content that solely
                promotes or advertises a Product or Service) requires a
                Commercial License Agreement to be signed and a License fee to
                be paid before an NCS track can be used in this way. Without a
                fully signed commercial license agreement your content is at
                risk of receiving a Copyright Strike.

                NCS primarily supports Independent Creators, whether Vlogger,

                primarily re-uploading our original video are likely to receive
